    "text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is perceived as a collection of smart, connected devices with the ability to send and receive data; “internet” encapsulates connectivity and “things” are devices (electronic or mechanical) that can be adapted toward connectivity. There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.\nThis workshop provides an introductory-level exposure of the IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. The attendees will be exposed to the IoT framework using sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in a “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language. The attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with a free version of RealVNC Viewer software downloaded and installed. The attendees will work in small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.\nThe workshop will facilitate learning about how IoT with edge computing capability is going to be the backbone of the Industry 4.0.",
