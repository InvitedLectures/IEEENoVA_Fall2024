    "text": "In the world of programming, an editor is more than just a text processor. It’s your creative workspace where you bring your code to life. Here are some key aspects of code editors:\n\nText Editing: At its core, an editor allows you to write, edit, and organize code in various programming languages. It provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code completion to enhance your coding experience.\nCode Execution: Some editors, like Jupyter Notebook, not only allow you to write code but also execute it in an interactive and step-by-step manner. This is especially useful for data analysis and experimentation.\nExtensions and Plugins: Code editors are highly customizable. You can enhance their functionality by installing extensions or plugins tailored to your needs. For example, you can add Python-specific tools or themes to make your editor visually appealing.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs): Some editors, such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), go beyond text editing and offer a complete integrated development environment with debugging capabilities, version control integration, and more.\nCollaboration: Many editors support collaborative coding, allowing multiple programmers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, which is crucial for group projects.\n\n\nThe following tools will help you throughout this workshop, helping you write, execute, and code effectively. Select the appropriate option for your operating system, follow the installation instructions, and dive into the world of coding with confidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install Real VNC Viewer for Mac OS 12+\n\nDonwload the installation file here\nFollow installation instructions here\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Connect to the Raspberry Pi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install Real VNC Viewer for Windows 10+\n\nDonwload the installation file here\nFollow installation instructions here\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Connect to the Raspberry Pi\n\n\nChoose the option that best suits your needs and follow the respective installation instructions.\nOnce you have an editor installed, you can start writing and running your code. Happy coding!\nAlso, once you’ve finished installation Steps 1 and 2, fill out the Installation Check-In form. \n\n\n\n\n\nContent on this webpage was partially generated using ChatGPT.",

There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.\nThis workshop provides an introductory-level exposure of the IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. The attendees will be exposed to the IoT framework using sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in a “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language.\nThe attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with the following requirements:\n\nPersonal machines or laptops (only) with:\n\nMac OS 12+ or Windows 10+ operating system\nOne USB A or USB C port that is available for use during the workshop\nWiFi connectivity\nA free version of RealVNC® Viewer software downloaded and installed (See instructions for details).\nChrome web browser downloaded and installed\n\n\nThe attendees will be expected to work\n\nin small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.\n\nThe workshop will facilitate learning about how IoT with edge computing capability is going to be the backbone of the Industry 4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime & Location of the Workshop\n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson Meeting Room 1\n\nThomas Jefferson Library\n7415 Arlington Boulevard\nFalls Church, VA 22042\n\nMeeting time\n\n9:00 AM – 12:00 Noon",

    "text": "Workshop abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is perceived as a collection of smart, connected devices with the ability to send and receive data; “internet” encapsulates connectivity and “things” are devices (electronic or mechanical) that can be adapted toward connectivity. There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.\n\n\n \n\nIoT by Alla Zaleuska from Noun Project\n\n\n\n This workshop provides an introductory-level exposure of the IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. The attendees will be exposed to the IoT framework using sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in a “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language.\nThe attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with the following requirements: \n\nPersonal machines or laptops (only) with:\n\nMac OS 12+ or Windows 10+ operating system\nOne USB A or USB C port that is available for use during the workshop\nWiFi connectivity\nA free version of RealVNC® Viewer software downloaded and installed (See instructions for details).\nChrome web browser downloaded and installed\n\n\nThe attendees will be expected to work \n\nin small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime & Location of the Workshop\n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson Meeting Room 1\n\nThomas Jefferson Library\n7415 Arlington Boulevard\nFalls Church, VA 22042\n\nMeeting time\n\n9:00 AM – 12:00 Noon",
